        Iâ€™m a person with an artistic approach to web and mobile applications
        development. I am deeply committed to creating interfaces that
        seamlessly blend form and function to provide a superior user
        experience. My action is characterized by independent and critical
        thinking, empathy and reflection. I strive to design a unique solution
        based on real requirements rather than guesses and preconceptions.
